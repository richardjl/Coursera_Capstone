## Capstone Project  

### Business Problem   

There are thousands of cities around the world. They are very diverse in terms of culture, economy etc. For a tourism company, to group all those popular cities into several clusters is very important. With this information, it will help clients to choose the right cities to visit, especially for those tourists who want to experience different cultures.  
  
In this pilot project, we will randomly choose 20-30 cities , use Foursquare API to retrieve the top popular sites in those cities and then clustering them into several clusters..  

### Data to be used:  
1. Foursquare location data

1. A list of famous tourism cities (20-30 cities)
